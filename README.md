# RCU85Projects
Assembly projects for the RCU85 controller board of the robot platform.

## Background
These projects suppliment the Video series on researching and re-constructing the robot platform and it's Intel 8085 based controller board, RCU85.

## Hardware and Electrical Designs
The mechanical and electrocal / electronic design files for the RCU85 and the robot platfor will be hosted in another Git repo, title TBD.

## RCU85 Assembler
The assember chosen is "asm85" (https://github.com/TomNisbet/asm85) as it can be compiled easily on a Linux x86 or ARM host. My development environment currently is a Raspberry Pi running this assembler.

The build system is 'Make' and so you will need to install make and its support tooling in order to use this system.
